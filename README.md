## Dashboard Setup üñ•Ô∏è

### 1. **Initialize & Design:**
   - Bootstrap a new React project using [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app). Design the UI with libraries like [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) or [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) for a modern look.
   - **Tip:** Command: `npx create-react-app nft-portfolio-visualizer`

### 2. **Fetch & Display NFT Data:**
   - Integrate with the Mobula API using Axios to fetch the NFT holdings. Display the fetched NFTs using React components.
   - **Tip:** Consider creating a custom hook to manage data fetching and state.

### 3. **Enhance Interactivity & Filters:**
   - Add features like click-to-enlarge for NFT images and implement basic filtering or search functionalities.
   - **Tip:** Use React's Context API for managing filter states across components.

### 4. **Responsive Check & Deployment:**
   - Ensure the dashboard is mobile-responsive using CSS frameworks like [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Once satisfied, deploy your application to platforms like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
